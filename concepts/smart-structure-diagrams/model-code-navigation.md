By model  - code navigation we understand the following items:

* after selecting a diagram element (e.g. class, method), the context menu action will propose some actions: *Show file in tree*, *Show file in editor*
* on right click from source code (in Eclipse, Web) , the context menu will show the diagrams that contain the element at cursor (file, class, method, etc)
* the Explorer tree will have a button similar with "Link with Editor" from Eclipse. Clicking on it will synchronize the tree with the current selection from diagram
