Flower Platform is a web based diagramming software, with a strong focus on source code. I.e. diagrams (UML-like) on which users can collaborate in real-time. Diagrams which are synchronized with the actual source code (e.g. from Git, SVN).

On the occasion of Flower Platform exhibiting at O'Reilly OSCON (Innovator's Pavilion, booth P14), we have some pieces of good news to share.

<div>
<p>
<strong>Good news #1.</strong> <a href="http://www.crispico.com">Crispico</a> <strong>open sources Flower Platform</strong>, under GPL v3. Flower Platform is an open software now, with an open diagramming/modeling language. The community will dictate (and even contribute) which are the features they need, specific to their workflows, programming languages and tools. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Good news #2.</strong> We'll be showing at our OSCON booth a <strong>sneak peek/demo</strong> of some very nice features of Flower Platform v2:
<ul>
<li>Diagrams and code on tablet and mobile</li>
<li>Smart structure diagrams: a new kind of diagram that combines a structure (or class) diagram and flow (interactions between code) on the same diagram.</li>
<li>Mindmap diagrams that synchronize data toward external tools (e.g. wiki, issue tracker).</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Good news #3.</strong> We have redone the Flower Platform <strong>web site</strong>. <a href="http://flower-platform.org">flower-platform.org</a> is, first of all, a communication platform between the <strong>community</strong> and the Flower Platform team (and vice-versa as well). E.g. the section <a href="http://flower-platform.org/concepts.html">Concepts + Discussions = Features</a> shows in the same place: what Flower Platform <em>does</em>, what it <em>will do</em>, <em>ideas</em> about what it should do and <em>discussions</em> around these points.

<p>
We are looking forward to meet people at OSCON, to learn about the programming languages they use, tools, workflows. And to discuss about how diagramming can help in their daily activities, and about what should Flower Platform do for them. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="label label-success">Remember Flower Platform philosophy</span> It is Flower Platform that should adapt to what the developers do and how they do it. And not the opposite! I.e. it is Flower Platform that should adapt to their programming languages (OOP or not!), their tools (IDE, Version Control, Issue Tracker, wiki, etc.) and their workflows.
