First of all, meet **Mr. Candy Robot v1**:

It's a [LEGO Minstorms EV3](http://mindstorms.lego.com/) based robot, that we've programmed to serve candies to people. We have used at the last 2 job fairs where Crispico participated: we were tempting people to come join our teams, saying that playing with LEGO is what we do; plus some software development during the "work" breaks. Which is true, depending on how you define a work break :).

So now seriously, what's the relation besides this **LEGO robot, [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and Flower Platform**? The answer is simple:

* [Flower Platform: Arduino Extension](/extensions/arduino):
* It aims to provide a graphical development environment for Arduino.
* It will be inspired mainly from the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 software (which is based on [LabVIEW](http://www.ni.com/labview/)). 

LEGO Mindstorms EV3 software looks like this:

The goal of Flower Platform: Arduino Extension is to provide an easy to use graphical development environment for Arduino enthusiasts, without having to write lots of lines of code. We would like to make the system as "bi-directionnal" as possible, meaning to be able to combine both graphical programming and "normal"/"text" programming.

And regarding Mr. Candy Robot: looking forward for v2, using an Arduino board programmed with the Flower Platform: Arduino Extension.
