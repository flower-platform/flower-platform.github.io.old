Sometimes not all merges can be done using Eclipse's **Git** perspective, in which case we need to install **Git** (it can be downloaded from [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads)). The installation comes with two different approaches of using Git: **Git GUI** - the graphical interface version - and **Git Bash** - the command line version.

It is up to you which one to use and when. For example, one of the cases when we use Git GUI is when using the **Prune** command. Details about this command can be found [here](../git/#Branchmanagement).
