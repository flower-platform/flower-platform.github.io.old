## How?
All the Git commands can be easily executed right from Eclipse, using the <span class="label label-info">Git Perspective</span>. In order to open the Git perspective, you have to choose the **Open perspective** option from the **Window** menu and to select **Git** from the **Other** section.

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Hint:</strong> Once you open a perspective once, Eclipse will remember it and will display it in the top-right corner. Also, you can switch the perspective using the <strong>Open Perspective</strong> button. <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="open-git-perspective-2.png"/></div>
